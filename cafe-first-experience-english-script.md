## Key Vocabulary & Phrases

**Casual/Natural language:**
- "I'll have..." / "I'll do..." / "Can I get..."
- "That's it" / "That's all"
- "All set" / "I'm good"
- "No rush" / "Whenever you're ready"
- "Looks good" / "Looks great"

**Avoiding overly formal:**
- Instead of "I would like to order," say "I'll have"
- Instead of "Excuse me, waiter," just make eye contact or say "Hey" politely
- You don't need to say "please" and "thank you" after every single sentence, but it's nice to include them naturally

This is how real people talk in American cafes!
