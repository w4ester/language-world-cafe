## 💡 Best Practices for Success

### For Students:
1. **Don't skip the script** - Reading first helps a lot
2. **Use push-to-talk properly** - Hold while speaking, release when done
3. **Speak clearly** - Whisper is accurate but needs clear audio
4. **Listen to AI** - Pay attention to natural phrasing
5. **Repeat stages** - Practice makes perfect
6. **View transcript** - Review what you said vs what AI said

### For Teachers:
1. **Assign script reading** first (homework or in-class)
2. **Demonstrate guided practice** - Show students how it works
3. **Set goals**: "Complete all 4 stages in English"
4. **Review transcripts** - Discuss what students said
5. **Encourage repetition** - Do guided practice multiple times
6. **Assessment**: Listen to students' free conversations
